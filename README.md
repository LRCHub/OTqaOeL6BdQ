```lrc
[01:16.72] You shout it loud, but I can't hear a word you say
[01:24.39] I'm talking loud, not saying much
[01:32.06] I'm criticized, but all your bullets ricochet
[01:39.52] You shoot me down, but I get up
[01:55.02] 
[01:47.33] I'm bulletproof, nothing to lose
[01:51.35] Fire away, fire away
[01:55.00] Ricochet, you take your aim
[01:59.01] Fire away, fire away
[02:09.01] 
[02:02.54] You shoot me down, but I won't fall
[02:06.50] I am titanium
[02:10.04] You shoot me down, but I won't fall
[02:14.02] I am titanium
[02:20.52] 
[03:15.07] I am titanium
[03:21.57] 
[03:22.81] Cut me down, but it's you who'll have further to fall
[03:30.03] Ghost town and haunted love
[03:38.02] Raise your voice, sticks and stones may break my bones
[03:45.53] I'm talking loud, not saying much
[04:02.03] 
[03:53.01] I'm bulletproof, nothing to lose
[03:57.04] Fire away, fire away
[04:00.88] Ricochet, you take your aim
[04:04.70] Fire away, fire away
[04:14.70] 
[04:08.28] You shoot me down, but I won't fall
[04:12.28] I am titanium
[04:16.05] You shoot me down, but I won't fall
[04:20.04] I am titanium
[04:26.54] 
[05:21.09] I am titanium
